Stem-Inclusive-noun_end-Tense (if the noun end is left away it is assumed to be singular nominative or the most recent fitting ending)
## Stem
 - am - 1. Person (Speaker)
 - an - 2. Person (Spoken to)
 - a(ng) - 3. Person (Other/Spoken about)
## Inclusive
 - o - include the speaker (optional; used in plural)

Tense markers of verbs are often used to remove ambiguity. Present would be equivalent to last noun, Past to the one before, Past-Past to the one before that, etc.
It's is frowned upon by some as not proper grammar, but allowed even in formal language.

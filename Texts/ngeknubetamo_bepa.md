they are, when a statement says thing and bad other-thing

They are statements, that mean both one thing and another bad thing.

Like this they show their agreement to eachother, while hiding it from others and preventing shaming.

Despite all of this "hidden speech" unlike "35" exists.

BS see-SUBNRM-statement-PLU1 statement-ACT-CONJ SUB-SING-AKK statement-ACT see-SUBNRM be-PLU1 BE or SUB-SING-AKK good-NRM see-SUBNRM-ACT statement-PLU1 BE BE

hiddenspeechs can say, that say hidden things, or, that good hide statements,

"hidden speech" can also mean, that you speak secrets, or, that you do hide your statements, but in a good way.

BS SUB-SING see-SUBNRM-ACT thing-SING-INST again-they-PLU1 and thing-ABL-PREV-ACT good-SUBNRM-statement-PLU1-AKK BE can be not good-SUBNRM can be good-NRM BE

that hide thing to other them and prevent bad-say, can be not bad can be good.

To hide something from others and prevent shame, is not neccisarily bad, but can even be good.
